      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a finance professional moving into web development. I live with my wife and Golden Retriever, Ciri!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Adelaide, South Australia</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love sport, the outdoors, fantasy novels, animals and all things social.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to help build video games. To be involved in the story, dialogue & then help build it would be a dream! I love a wide variety of games & wouldn't be fussy with the genre, provided there is a good story behind it.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Adelaide, South Australia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I found finance frustrating because there's no room for creativity and to build things. The future is online and being a web developer puts you in the driver's seat!</p>
